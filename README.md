Sit back, relax, and enjoy your recreational distraction from your boring and banal lifestyle - the way it was meant to be enjoyed!

(Although this app is planned to have online access eventually, we do not have things up and running just yet. If you wish to see the in-progress app, simply download all the files, open VisualStudioCode, and in the terminal (set to WSL) run the command 'npm i' to install the dependencies, then 'npm run dev'. Be sure to make a .env.local file in the main directory and put in a 62-char password for the IRON_PASS).
